# UI Engineer Storybook Pairing

Welcome to the Pantheon technical interview process. We have a non-industry standard coding challenge ahead of you. This will be an open-book pairing-like panel interview. Yes, we really mean you can Google something. We don't want you to do any work now, but we do ask that you get this repository [duplicated](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) (not a basic clone), installed, and running on your local machine.

If you have any problems at all, please reach out to your interview coordinator to pair you up with someone to fix whatever issue you might be having. We ask each other for help all the time, don't be shy if you get stuck!

## Installation

1. Duplicate the repository (aka bare / mirror)
1. Install the dependencies: `yarn install` or `npm install` from the folder you duplicated
1. Ensure Storybook is up and running: `yarn storybook` or `npm storybook`
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:6006/`, if you see the Storybook Introduction you're all set

Feel free to poke around the code. We'll see you at your interview, good luck!
